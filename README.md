## About -
I'm Kotipalli Udaykumar — focused on Active Directory offense & defense, network exploitation, and practical lab work. I build reproducible AD homelabs (Red vs Blue), collect telemetry, and write detection playbooks. I keep notes tight, actionable, and usable in real engagements.

**Primary:** Pentesting · Active Directory · Network Forensics · Linux (Kali) · Python

## Skills & Tools :
**Offense:** Nmap, BloodHound, Impacket, Responder, CrackMapExec, PowerShell (theory), Metasploit (tooling)  
**Defense:** Sysmon, ELK/Splunk basics, Windows Event Log hunting, GPO hardening, LAPS  
**Env:** Windows Server (AD), Windows 10/11, Kali Linux, VirtualBox/VMware  
**Scripting:** Python (automation / parsing / helpers)

## Projects :
- **Active Directory Homelab** — Red vs Blue lab for enumeration, privilege escalation, and detection  
- **Network Pentest Lab** — LLMNR/NetBIOS poisoning demos (lab only) & Wireshark captures  
- **Pentest Notes** — Cheat-sheets, workflows, sysmon snippets, and hunt queries

## What you'll find in this profile
- Fully documented AD homelab (topology, snapshots, setup notes)  
- Detection playbooks & Sysmon configuration snippets  
- Pentest one-liners & procedural checklists (organized, not loud)  
- Clean, evidence-focused screenshots and exported BloodHound graphs

## Ethics & Final Word
I test only on systems I own or have permission for. Understand *why* before *how*.  
No shortcuts — learn, break, detect, harden, repeat.

> Hack responsibly. Learn deliberately. Stay curious.
